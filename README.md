# üõ°Ô∏è Simple WordPress Honeypot

A lightweight and deceptive WordPress login honeypot designed to identify and log brute-force attempts. This project mimics a real `wp-admin` login page, captures attacker credentials, and stores detailed access logs ‚Äî useful for cybersecurity learning, threat analysis, and portfolio demonstration.

## üöÄ Features

* üé≠ Realistic fake WordPress login interface
* üìù Logs attacker attempts to `http_audits.log` (IP, timestamp, credentials)
* üëÄ Helps detect brute-force bot behavior
* üß† Great for ethical hacking practice & security research
* üß∞ No real backend ‚Äî safe to host publicly **only in controlled environments**

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
/honeypot/
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-admin-login.html    # Fake WordPress login page
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py              # Logging logic (Python)
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ http_audits.log        # Attack logs (add to .gitignore before pushing)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Attacker lands on fake WP login page
2. Enters credentials (thinking it's real)
3. Submission triggers the logging script
4. Data recorded: IP üåê | Username üë§ | Password üîë | Timestamp ‚è±Ô∏è

---

## üéØ Purpose

> This honeypot is intended for **ethical cybersecurity research, learning, and monitoring automated bot attacks**. Not for malicious use.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Basic web hosting or local machine

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Locally

```sh
# run the server (example)
python server.py
# then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
```

**Deployment (free options ‚Äî notes):**

* Render.com ‚Äî easy deployment for simple web apps
* Replit ‚Äî beginner-friendly (may have limitations)
* GitHub Pages ‚Äî static HTML only (server logic won't run)
* Railway ‚Äî alternative to Render

## üìä Example Log Output

```
[2025-11-01 01:21:41] IP: 127.0.0.1 | USER: admin | PASS: admin@123
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Notice

You are responsible for how you use this project. Logging credentials or other personal data may be illegal in many jurisdictions if done outside your own, controlled environment. **Do not deploy this against third-party systems or capture data from users who haven't consented.**

If you intend to run this publicly, take steps to minimize legal risk:

* Run it on infrastructure you own or control.
* Avoid collecting or storing personally identifiable information (PII) where possible.
* Anonymize or redact logs if they include real user data.
* Consult local laws and your organization‚Äôs security/compliance team.

---

## üîê Security & Privacy Recommendations

* Add `http_audits.log` (and any other logs) to `.gitignore` before pushing to a public repo.
* Consider not storing raw passwords; if you must, secure the storage and rotate logs frequently.
* Prefer capturing metadata (IP, user-agent, timestamp) over PII.
* Rate-limit and sandbox the honeypot to avoid it being used as a pivot point.

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements

* Email alerting on suspicious activity
* IP reputation lookups
* Web dashboard to view and filter logs
* Docker / cloud deployment templates
